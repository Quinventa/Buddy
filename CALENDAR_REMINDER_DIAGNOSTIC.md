# Calendar Reminder Diagnostic Guide

## Problem: Not Receiving Calendar Reminders

### Step 1: Check Browser Console Logs

Open your browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab) and look for these messages:

#### ‚úÖ **What You SHOULD See:**
```
[CALENDAR-REMINDER] Starting calendar event monitoring for user: <user-id> with timezone: <timezone>
[CALENDAR-REMINDER] Checking for upcoming events to schedule reminders...
[CALENDAR-REMINDER] Found X upcoming events
[CALENDAR-REMINDER] ‚úÖ Successfully created reminder for event: <event-name>
[v0] üîÑ Buddy-app checking for calendar reminders at: <timestamp>
```

#### ‚ùå **Problem Indicators:**
- **"No Google Calendar access token found"** ‚Üí Go to Step 2
- **"Access token expired"** ‚Üí Go to Step 3
- **"Found 0 upcoming events"** ‚Üí Go to Step 4
- **"Reminders disabled for user"** ‚Üí Go to Step 5
- **"Reminder already exists for event"** ‚Üí Go to Step 6

---

### Step 2: Check Google Calendar Connection

**Issue:** Not connected to Google Calendar

**Solution:**
1. Open Settings (gear icon)
2. Scroll to "Connections" section
3. Look for Google Calendar status
4. If not connected or showing "Already Connected" but not working:
   - Click "Disconnect Google Calendar" (if visible)
   - Wait 2 seconds
   - Click "Connect Google Calendar"
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - **Grant calendar permissions** when asked
5. Refresh the page

---

### Step 3: Token Expired - Reconnect

**Issue:** Google tokens expired (happens after 6 months or security changes)

**Solution:**
1. Settings ‚Üí Connections
2. Disconnect Google Calendar
3. Reconnect and grant permissions
4. Check console for: "Token refresh successful"

---

### Step 4: No Events Found

**Issue:** System can't see your Google Calendar events

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Wrong Calendar:** Check if the event is in your PRIMARY Google Calendar
2. **Private Event:** Make sure event is not set to "Private"
3. **Different Account:** Verify you connected the right Google account
4. **Event Time:** Event must be within next 7 days

**Check Console For:**
```
[CALENDAR-REMINDER] Failed to fetch calendar events: 403
```
If you see 403, you didn't grant calendar permissions.

**Solution:**
1. Go to Google Calendar (calendar.google.com)
2. Verify the event exists in your PRIMARY calendar
3. If event is in a different calendar, move it to primary
4. Reconnect Google Calendar and grant ALL permissions

---

### Step 5: Reminders Disabled

**Issue:** Calendar reminders are turned off in settings

**Solution:**
1. Settings ‚Üí Calendar Reminders section
2. Toggle "Enable Calendar Reminders" to ON
3. Set "Default Reminder Time" (30 minutes recommended)
4. Click "Save Settings"
5. Check console for: "Settings Saved"

---

### Step 6: Reminder Already Created But Not Triggering

**Issue:** Reminder exists in database but notification didn't appear

**Run SQL Diagnostic:**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Run this query:

```sql
-- Check your pending reminders
SELECT 
  event_title,
  event_start_time AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York' AS event_time_local,
  reminder_time AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York' AS reminder_time_local,
  minutes_before_event,
  is_triggered,
  triggered_at,
  CASE 
    WHEN reminder_time <= NOW() THEN 'SHOULD HAVE TRIGGERED'
    ELSE 'NOT YET DUE'
  END AS status,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (reminder_time - NOW())) / 60 AS minutes_until_reminder
FROM calendar_event_reminders
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  AND is_triggered = false
  AND is_dismissed = false
ORDER BY reminder_time ASC;
```

**Replace `America/New_York` with your timezone!**

**Interpret Results:**
- **"SHOULD HAVE TRIGGERED"**: Reminder is overdue - check if monitoring is running
- **"NOT YET DUE"**: Reminder will trigger when time comes
- **No rows**: No reminders scheduled - system didn't detect your event

---

### Step 7: Force Manual Check

**In Browser Console, run:**
```javascript
// Check if monitoring is running
console.log(window.reminderCheckInterval ? "‚úÖ Monitoring ACTIVE" : "‚ùå Monitoring INACTIVE")

// Check calendar status
const { createClient } = await import('./lib/supabase')
const supabase = createClient()
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
console.log("User ID:", user?.id)

// Check for connected account
const { data: account } = await supabase
  .from('user_connected_accounts')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .eq('provider', 'google')
  .single()
console.log("Google Account:", account)

// Check preferences
const { data: prefs } = await supabase
  .from('user_calendar_reminder_preferences')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .single()
console.log("Preferences:", prefs)
```

### Step 8: Common Issues

#### Issue: "Reminder time already passed"
**Cause:** You're testing with an event that's too soon
**Solution:** Create a test event at least 35 minutes in the future (30 min reminder + 5 min buffer)

#### Issue: Console shows "Created reminder" but no notification
**Cause:** Notification panel might be hidden or browser notifications blocked
**Solution:** 
- Check if notification bell icon shows a number
- Check browser notification permissions
- Make sure page is not in background tab when reminder triggers

#### Issue: Multiple reminders for same event
**Cause:** Page refreshed multiple times
**Solution:** System prevents duplicates - only first reminder will trigger

---

### Step 9: Test With Fresh Event

1. **Create Test Event:**
   - Go to Google Calendar
   - Create new event: "Test Reminder"
   - Set time: **35 minutes from now**
   - Save event

2. **Wait 2 Minutes:**
   - System checks for new events every 2 minutes
   - Watch console for: "Found 1 upcoming events"
   - Should see: "‚úÖ Successfully created reminder for event: Test Reminder"

3. **Wait for Reminder Time:**
   - System checks every 10 seconds for due reminders
   - When current time reaches (event_time - 30 minutes), notification will appear

---

### Step 10: Nuclear Option - Full Reset

If nothing works:

1. **Clear All Data:**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
DELETE FROM calendar_event_reminders WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
DELETE FROM user_calendar_reminder_preferences WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
```

2. **Disconnect Everything:**
   - Settings ‚Üí Connections ‚Üí Disconnect Google Calendar
   - Sign out of the app
   - Clear browser cache for your app's domain

3. **Fresh Start:**
   - Sign in with Google
   - Grant ALL permissions
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Calendar Reminders
   - Enable reminders, set 30 minutes
   - Save settings
   - Create test event 35 minutes in future
   - Wait and observe console logs

---

## Key Timing Facts

- **Event Check Interval:** Every 2 minutes
- **Reminder Check Interval:** Every 10 seconds  
- **Default Reminder Time:** 30 minutes before event
- **Customizable Range:** 1 minute to 1 day before event

## Expected Log Flow

For an event at 8:00 PM with 30-minute reminder:

```
7:25 PM: [CALENDAR-REMINDER] Found 1 upcoming events
7:25 PM: [CALENDAR-REMINDER] ‚úÖ Created reminder (will trigger at 7:30 PM)
7:30 PM: [v0] üìã Found 1 triggered calendar reminders
7:30 PM: [v0] Created notification and chat message
7:30 PM: üîä About to speak reminder
```

---

## Still Not Working?

Open browser console and take a screenshot of ALL logs, then share:
1. Full console output from page load
2. Your timezone setting (Settings ‚Üí Timezone dropdown)
3. Screenshot of Google Calendar showing the event
4. Result of the SQL diagnostic query

This will help identify the exact issue!
